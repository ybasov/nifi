        <p>
        	The JsonTreeReader Controller Service, by default, derives the schema for a FlowFile
        	based on the first JSON Object in the FlowFile. For each field found, the data type
        	is inferred. However, the type of a field can be overridden by adding a user-defined property to
        	the Controller Service. The name of the property should be the same as the name of the
        	JSON field. The value of the property denotes the data type of the corresponding field.
        	If no JSON field is found with a matching name, then a field will be added to the schema,
        	and a <code>null</code> value will be used for any record for which the JSON field
        	is not present. If a field is found with a matching name, but the type is different,
        	the Controller Service will attempt to coerce the value into the user-defined type. If unable
        	to do so, an Exception will be thrown.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        	When specifying a data type for a field, the following values are valid:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
        	<li><b>string</b></li>
        	<li><b>boolean</b></li>
        	<li><b>byte</b></li>
        	<li><b>char</b></li>
        	<li><b>short</b></li>
        	<li><b>int</b></li>
        	<li><b>bigint</b></li>
        	<li><b>long</b></li>
        	<li><b>float</b></li>
        	<li><b>double</b></li>
        	<li><b>date</b> - A date with no time field. By default, the format used is <code>yyyy-MM-dd</code>. This can be overridden
        		by adding a colon (:) followed by the desired format. For example: <code>date:MM/dd/yyyy</code>. The format to use is
        		that of Java's SimpleDateFormat (see <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html">
        		SimpleDateFormat Patterns</a> for more information).
        	</li>
        	<li><b>time</b> - A time with no date field. By default, the format used is <code>HH:mm:ss</code>. This can be overridden
        		by adding a colon (:) followed by the desired format. For example: <code>time:hh:mm:ss a</code>. The format to use is
        		that of Java's SimpleDateFormat (see <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html">
        		SimpleDateFormat Patterns</a> for more information).
        	</li>
        	<li><b>timestamp</b> - A field that represents both a date and time. By default, the format used is
        		<code>yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss</code>. This can be overridden by adding a colon (:) followed by the desired format. For example:
        		<code>MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss a</code>. The format to use is
        		that of Java's SimpleDateFormat (see <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html">
        		SimpleDateFormat Patterns</a> for more information).</li>
        	<li><b>object</b> - The value will be returned as a <code>Map&lt;String, Object&gt;</code>. The types of the values in the Map
        		are always inferred. The type used for the values may not be the same for each record. For example, consider the following
        		JSON array:
        			<br /><br />
        			<code>
        			[{
        			    id: 17,
        			  	name: "John",
        			    child: {
        			    	id: "1"
        			    },
        			    siblingIds: [4, "8"]
        			  },
        			  <br />{
        			  	id: 98,
        			    name: "Jane",
        			    child: {
        			        id: 2
        			    },
        			    siblingIds: []
        			  }]
        			</code>
        			<br /><br />
        		In this case, the <code>child</code> element would be inferred to be of type <code>object</code>. Since nested types
        		are inferred on a per-record basis, for the first record, the <code>child</code> field would return a <code>Map</code>
        		where the value of the <code>id</code> entry is a <code>string</code>. However, for the second record, the <code>child</code>
        		field would return a <code>Map</code> where the value of the <code>id</code> entry is an <code>int</code>.
        		<br />
        		Moreover, the <code>siblingIds</code> of the John will be an <code>array</code> where the first element is an <code>int</code>
        		and the second element is a <code>string</code>. The <code>siblingIds</code> of Jane will be an empty array.
        		</li>
        	<li><b>array</b> - An array of values. The types of the values are always inferred and may not be the same for each element
        		in the array, or for two arrays from different JSON objects.</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
