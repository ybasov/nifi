<h3>Important Security Note</h3>
<p>
    There are certain risks in allowing the account name and key to be stored as flowfile
    attributes. While it does provide for a more flexible flow by allowing the account name and key
    be fetched dynamically from the flow file attributes, care must be taken to restrict access to
    the recorded event provenance data (e.g. by strictly controlling the provenance policy permission).
    In addition, the provenance repositories may be put on encrypted disk partitions.
