/**
 * The ProcessorLog is an extension of ComponentLog but provides no additional
 * functionality. It exists because ProcessorLog was created first, but when
 * Controller Services and Reporting Tasks began to be used more heavily loggers
 * were needed for them as well. We did not want to return a ProcessorLog to a
 * ControllerService or a ReportingTask, so all of the methods were moved to a
 * higher interface named ComponentLog. However, we kept the ProcessorLog
 * interface around in order to maintain backward compatibility.
 *
 * @deprecated use the super interface {@link ComponentLog}
